--SKUNK--
    * 5 columns (S K U N K)
    * one person rolls 2 dice
    * tally total points from roll under 'S'
    * once a 1 is rolled - all points in that column are lost - next column/round starts
    * you can pull out at any time (if you don't want to lose all your points)
    * at end of 5 rounds, points are added - most points wins!
